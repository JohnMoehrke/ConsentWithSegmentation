# warnings that are not critical to the reason these examples exist
WARNING: Observation/ex-ObservationAlcoholUse: Observation.value.ofType(Quantity): UCUM Codes that contain human readable annotations like {wine glasses} can be misleading (e.g. they are ignored when comparing units). Best Practice is not to depend on annotations in the UCUM code, so this usage should be checked, and the Quantity.unit SHOULD contain the annotation
WARNING: Observation/ex-ObservationAlcoholUse: Observation: Best Practice Recommendation: In general, all observations should have a performer
WARNING: Observation/ex-bloodSugarB-0: Observation: Best Practice Recommendation: In general, all observations should have a performer
